# 2D-Projectile-Motion-Game

Server runs locally, it should be open with atleast 2 games to function.

The mapdata for Venus and Mercury was not comlete. Launching them will crash the game.

Temp_client was used to test the server. It is included for completeness and to fill out the development process.
